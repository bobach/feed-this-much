# Welcome to Recurrent's II1305 Project
We are developing a website that generates personalized feeding schedules for pet owners based on their pet's information and other key factors. 

The platform is specifically designed for cat and dog owners.


## Project Feed This Much

**Feed This Much** helps pet owners create a personalized feeding schedule tailored to their petâ€™s specific needs.

  - Switching from one type of food to another, as this often requires mixing the two foods together and gradually increasing one kind and phasing out the other
  - Feeding a pet a combination of two or more types of food, such as some wet food and some dry
food (kibble)
   - The pet has special dietary requirements, such as age (growing still or ageing), illness, disability(restricting activity), pregnant or nursing, being over or under-weight, or is a breed that is much larger or smaller than average

## How to do it?
You can login your pet(s) and their food(s). Based on the physical state of your pet and your meal plan you will receive a feeding schedule based on the food you own or plan on feeding your pet(s).
