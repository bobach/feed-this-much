# Welcome to Recurrent's II1305 Project
We are developing a web app that generates personalized feeding plans for pet owners based on their pet's information and other key factors. 

The platform is specifically designed for cat and dog owners.

## Project Feed This Much

**Feed This Much** helps pet owners create a personalized feeding plan tailored to their petâ€™s specific needs.

  - Switching from one type of food to another, as this often requires mixing the two foods together and gradually increasing one kind and phasing out the other
  - Feeding a pet a combination of two or more types of food, such as some wet food and some dry
food (kibble)
   - The pet has special dietary requirements, such as age (growing still or ageing), illness, disability(restricting activity), pregnant or nursing, being over or under-weight, or is a breed that is much larger or smaller than average

## How to do it?
You can enter information about your pet(s) and their food(s). Based on the age, weight, activity level, physical condition and other key information about your pet, and information from the food you give them (calories and key nutrient details you can find on the packet), you will receive a daily feeding plan that makes sure you are feeding your pet the right amount - not too much, and not too little...this much!
