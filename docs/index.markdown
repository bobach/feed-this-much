# Welcome to Recurrent's II1305 Project
We are developing a website that generates personalized feeding schedules for pet owners based on their pet's information and other key factors. The platform is specifically designed for cat and dog owners.


## Project <strong>Feed This Much</strong>
<strong>Feed This Much</strong> helps pet owners create a personalized feeding schedule tailored to their petâ€™s specific needs.
<ul>
  <li>Switching from one type of food to another, as this often requires mixing the two foods together and gradually increasing one kind and phasing out the other</li>
  <li>Feeding a pet a combination of two or more types of food, such as some wet food and some dry
food (kibble)</li>
  <li>The pet has special dietary requirements, such as age (growing still or ageing), illness, disability(restricting activity), pregnant or nursing, being over or under-weight, or is a breed that is much larger or smaller than average</li>
</ul>

## How to do it?
You can login your pet(s) and their food(s). Based on the physical state of your pet and your meal plan you will receive a feeding schedule based on the food you own or plan on feeding your pet(s).
